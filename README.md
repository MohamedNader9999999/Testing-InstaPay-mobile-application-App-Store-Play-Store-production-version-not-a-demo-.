# Exploratory Testing of InstaPay Mobile App

## Overview

Our team Performed an **Exploratory Test Plan** on the **InstaPay mobile application** (production version from App Store and Play Store).

Our objectives were to:

* Plan and execute exploratory testing on both **Android** and **iOS**.
* Document a complete **User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Report**.
* Design and execute detailed **test cases**.
* Record and classify **bugs** based on severity.

---

## Scope & Deliverables

This repository contains:

* **UAT Report** – validating InstaPay against user needs.
* **Test Cases Report** – reproducible steps, expected results, and actual results.
* **Test Execution Report** – coverage, pass/fail rate, and summary.
* **Bug Report** – including screenshots, severity classification (High / Medium / Low), and environment details.

---

## Testing Approach

1. **Requirement Analysis** – understood the core flows and features of InstaPay.
2. **Exploratory Testing** – focused on usability, reliability, and edge cases.
3. **Cross-Platform Testing** – executed tests on Android and iOS devices.
4. **Bug Reporting** – created reproducible, well-documented bug reports.

## Key Findings

We discovered **15 bugs** across both platforms — a surprisingly high number for a widely used, production-level application.

| Severity | Number of Bugs | Examples                                                  |
| -------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| High     | 9              | Defects on transfer feature and some security validations |
| Medium   | 4              | Unexpected innocuous behaviors                            |
| Low      | 2              | Suggested enhancements                                    |

This outcome highlights that exploratory testing remains crucial for uncovering real-world issues, even in professionally deployed apps.

## Lessons Learned

* **Exploratory testing is critical** for finding edge-case issues.
* **Cross-platform coverage** ensures platform-specific issues are detected early.
* **No app is truly bug-free**, even those with millions of users.
